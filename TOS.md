generates a random number, between 1 and 6, to symbolise a revolver. if the number is 6, the program deletes all files. This cannot be 
undone. In order to run the program, you must uncomment the `ready = False` line, and change `False` to `True`. The file will not run if 
you don't change the file. It was designed like this to make sure that you don't accidentally break your computer.
